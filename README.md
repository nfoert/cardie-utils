# cardie-utils

This is a collection of utilites and scripts for [Cardie](https://github.com/nfoert/cardie)

Scripts included in this repo:
- `generate_icon_list.py`

## Installation
First create a python virtual enviroment, activate it, and then install all packages you need from `requirements.txt`.

## Usage
### Generate Icon List
Run the script with
```
python generate_icon_list.py <DIRECTORY>
```
It will create an `icons_list.txt` file with the name of each file in the directory. I use this for downloading all Phosphor icons and then using the script to list all the files.
